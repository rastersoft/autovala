# HOW TO INSTALL

You need CMake, Vala 0.20 or later, libgee and gtk+.
The repository includes a version of CMake for Vala
that includes some changes (not mine) to support
Valadoc. These changes still aren't available at the
oficial repository. You can get the oficial files with

    bzr checkout lp:~elementary-apps/+junk/cmake-modules

This will create a folder called *cmake-modules*. Inside
it will be a folder called *cmake*. Copy the later to the
Autovala project folder, overwriting the files inside.

Don't forget to keep the files FindValadoc.cmake and
Valadoc.cmake, needed to work with Valadoc.

To compile and install it, just open a terminal, go
to the directory where you downloaded the git repository
and type:

    mkdir install
    cd install
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

If you are using GTK 3.4 or previous, you must specify it
to avoid the plugins to use newer widgets, not supported
in old GTK versions:

    mkdir install
    cd install
    cmake .. -DGTK_OLD=on
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

The Gedit and Scratch plugins are compiled and installed
separately. Just follow the instructions available in each
folder.
