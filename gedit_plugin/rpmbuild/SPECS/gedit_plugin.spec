%description
This is a plugin for GEdit 3 that integrates the project manager
AutoVala, allowing to use GEdit as a fully-fledged IDE for creating
projects in VALA language.
.
The plugin adds a left panel which shows the binaries and libraries
being created by an AutoVala project and its source files, allowing
to choose them just by clicking on each. It also shows all the other
files in the project (doc, po, data...) and the AVPRJ file.
.
To open an AutoVala project, just open any of the files belonging to
it, and the plugin will autodetect the project and show all the data.
.
Remember that you need Autovala installed in your system.
