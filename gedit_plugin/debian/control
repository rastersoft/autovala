Description: This is a plugin for GEdit 3 that integrates the project manager
 AutoVala, allowing to use GEdit as a fully-fledged IDE for creating
 projects in VALA language.
 .
 The plugin adds a left panel which shows the binaries and libraries
 being created by an AutoVala project and its source files, allowing
 to choose them just by clicking on each. It also shows all the other
 files in the project (doc, po, data...) and the AVPRJ file.
 .
 To open an AutoVala project, just open any of the files belonging to
 it, and the plugin will autodetect the project and show all the data.
 .
 Remember that you need Autovala installed in your system.
